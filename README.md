# Retro

> A toolkit for pragmatic programmers.

## Why does this library includes so many things?

I don't want to publish too many packages which aren't useful for others. That would pollute Hex.pm and waste the precious names.

So, I packed all my own requirements into this package.

## Installation

Install retro by adding `retro` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:retro, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Docs

Visit [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/retro).

<!--
Import config in your `config/config.exs`

```elixir
import Config

import_config "../deps/retro/config/config.exs"
```
-->
