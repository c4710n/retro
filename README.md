# Retro

> A toolkit for pragmatic Elixir programmers.

## Why does this library includes so many things?

I don't want to publish too many packages which aren't useful for others. That would pollute Hex.pm and waste the precious names.

So, I packed all my own requirements into this package.

## Installation

Install retro by [adding `retro`](https://hex.pm/packages/retro) to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`.
